For the past couple of weeks (from Dec 2023-Jan 2024), my DMs have been flooded with requests for the scripts I made for the YouTube and TikTok shorts. I tried doing this one by one, but realised quickly this isn't sustainable...

So...the easiest solution I could come up with was to just make it publicly available for everyone!

Moving forward, I'll be storing the code snippets I use in my online content so you can replicate the examples in your own environments or use it as a learning resource in a way that makes sense for you!
